                <p>Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn (1606 – 1669), usually simply known as <b>Rembrandt</b>, was a
                    <em>Dutch Golden Age</em> painter, printmaker, and draughtsman. He is generally considered one of
                    the greatest visual artists in the history of art. It is estimated Rembrandt produced a total of
                    about three hundred paintings, three hundred etchings, and two thousand drawings.</p>

                <p>Unlike most Dutch painters of the 17th century, Rembrandt's works depict a wide range of styles and
                    subject matter, from portraits and self-portraits to landscapes, genre scenes, allegorical and
                    historical scenes, biblical and mythological themes and animal studies. His contributions to art
                    came in a period that historians call the Dutch Golden Age.</p>

                <p>Rembrandt never went abroad but was considerably influenced by the work of the Italian <em>Old
                        Masters</em> and Dutch and Flemish artists who had studied in Italy. After he achieved youthful
                    success as a portrait painter, Rembrandt's later years were marked by personal tragedy and financial
                    hardships. Yet his etchings and paintings were popular throughout his lifetime, his reputation as an
                    artist remained high, and for twenty years he taught many important Dutch painters. Rembrandt's
                    portraits of his contemporaries, self-portraits and illustrations of scenes from the Bible are
                    regarded as his greatest creative triumphs.</p>

                <h4>Rembrandt chronology</h4>
                <p class="chrono">July 15, 1606</p>
                <p>Rembrandt van Rijn is born. His parents are father, Harmen Gerritzsoon van Rijn, a wealthy and
                    prosperous miller, and mother, Neeltgen Willemsdochter van Zuytbrouck, the daughter of a baker.
                    Rembrandt was one of 10 children, of which two died in infancy.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="chrono">1613 to 1615</p>
                <p>His parents see great potential in Rembrandt as an artist and send him to the Latin School in
                    preparation for admission to the Leiden University.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="chrono">1619</p>
                <p>Rembrandt begins a three-year apprenticeship under artist Jacob Isaacszoon van Swanenburgh
                    (1571-1638), who is a well-known Leiden painter.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="chrono">1620</p>
                <p>In May, Rembrandt attends the Leiden University, two months prior to his 14th birthday. Here he
                    learns classical and biblical stories that later became subjects of his paintings. He is only there
                    for a short time.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="chrono">1622</p>
                <p>Rembrandt is living with his parents in Weddesteeg, Leiden, along with his brothers and sisters
                    Gerrit, Machtelt, Cornelis and Lysbeth. His other brothers, Willem and Adriaen, have already left
                    home.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="chrono">1624 to 1625</p>
                <p>Rembrandt spends six months in Amsterdam studying under renowned painters Pieter Lastman and Jaun
                    Pynas. He studies history, rhetorical gestures, textual accuracy and other techniques, which are
                    important to his work later on.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="chrono">1624</p>
                <p>Rembrandt and fellow apprentice Jan Lievens (1607 to 1674), who also studied under Lastman and Pynas,
                    set up an art studio together in Leiden.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="chrono">1625 to 1631</p>
                <p>Rembrandt becomes a known painter in Leiden while still living at home with his parents. “The Stoning
                    of Stephen” is Rembrandt’s earliest dated painting, created during this time. Rembrandt is regularly
                    mentioned as a painter from this year on.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="chrono">1628</p>
                <p>In February, Rembrandt takes on his first pupils, Gerrit Dou (1613 to 1675) and Isaac de Jouderville
                    (1612 to 1645), who later became well-known Dutch Golden Age artists.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="chrono">1628</p>
                <p>Arnold van Buchel (1565-1641), an Utrecht lawyer and a humanist, visits Rembrandt in Leiden and
                    states in a diary that Rembrandt is causing a sensation as an artist. Among his artworks talked
                    about are two etchings of an old woman that are believed to be his mother, as well as a few self
                    portraits.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="chrono">1630</p>
                <p>After a visit to the Northern Netherlands, Ambassador Sir Robert Kerr (1578-1654), who would later
                    become the first Earl of Ancrum, gives several of Rembrandt’s paintings to King Charles I, including
                    one that the artist created of himself that year, which is his earliest dated self-portrait.</p>
                <p>Constantijn Huygens (1596-1687), the secretary to Stadholder Frederick Henry, visits Rembrandt’s
                    Leiden studio. Not long after, Huygens commissions Rembrandt to paint for The Hague Court.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="chrono">1631</p>
                <p>Rembrandt moves to Amsterdam, staying at the home of a friend, Hendrick Uylenburgh. Rembrandt uses
                    studio space to paint and becomes a known portraitist.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="chrono">1634</p>
                <p>Rembrandt marries Saskia Uylenburgh (1612-1642) from Friesland. She is the cousin of Rembrandt’s
                    landlord and partner, Hendrick Uylenburgh, and the daughter of the late burgomaster of Leeuwarden,
                    who was also a successful art dealer. They live with her cousin in his house, and remain married
                    until her death.</p>
                <p>Rembrandt becomes an Amsterdam citizen. He also joins the local St. Luke’s Guild, which is a union
                    artists are required by law to join in order to make and sell their art.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="chrono">1635 to 1641</p>
                <p>The first of four children that Rembrandt and Saskia have together is born. However, three die as
                    infants, and only one, son Titus born in September 1641, survives until adulthood.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="chrono">1639</p>
                <p>Rembrandt moves into his townhouse in St. Anthonisbreestraat in Amsterdam, now known as the
                    “Rembrandt House.” It was an area inhabited by many artists.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="chrono">1642</p>
                <p>Rembrandt’s wife Saskia dies, apparently from tuberculosis. He hires Geertje Dircks as the nanny for
                    his son Titus. Soon after, they begin a relationship together and she later becomes his common-law
                    wife. Troubles in their relationship led to Geertje leaving the home in 1647 and later to be jailed.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p class="chrono">1647</p>
                <p>Rembrandt hires new house servant and wet-nurse, Hendrickje Stoffels. Rembrandt was already having a
                    romantic relationship with Hendrickje upon her employ, which began during the latter part of the
                    time he was with Geertje Dircks. Hendrickje later became his common-law wife, and they stayed
                    together until her death by the plague in 1663.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="chrono">1649 to 1656</p>
                <p>Geertje Dircks sues Rembrandt for breach-of-promise for not wedding her. Rembrandt would have lost
                    his inheritance that he received through his deceased wife’s family had he remarried, so he refused.
                    Dircks was awarded by the Dutch courts 200 guilders a year, for life, as a maintenance allowance.
                    However, Dircks wanted more money and refused to sign the paperwork for her compensation award, so
                    Rembrandt had her imprisoned in 1650 for breach-of-contract. Dircks remained behind bars for five
                    years, and was released a year prior to her death in 1656.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="chrono">1649</p>
                <p>Rembrandt starts having financial problems, due in part to his breach-of-promise to Geertje Dircks in
                    which he was ordered to pay 200 guilders a year to her for life and for his bad business
                    investments.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="chrono">1654</p>
                <p>Rembrandt and Hendrickje Stoffels have an illegitimate daughter together named Cornelia. They along
                    with his son from his first marriage, Titus, live at Rembrandt’s St. Anthonisbreestraat house in
                    Amsterdam.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="chrono">1656</p>
                <p>Rembrandt is declared bankrupt by the High Court of Holland.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="chrono">1656 to 1658</p>
                <p>In order to save his inheritance, Rembrandt’s home is placed in his son Titus’s name. His property is
                    liquidated and his goods are taken and sold at auction. Rembrandt makes another poor investment of
                    cargo that becomes lost at sea, including two of his paintings.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="chrono">1658</p>
                <p>Rembrandt, Hendrickje Stoffels, Titus and Cornelia leave the St. Anthonisbreestraat home and move
                    into a rented house in Rozengracht, located in the Jordaan district of Amsterdam. Rembrandt paints
                    himself seated in state like a monarch, and this etched self-portrait is the last he does in this
                    medium.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="chrono">1660</p>
                <p>On December 15, Rembrandt gives financial control of his company over to his son Titus and to his
                    partner Hendrick Uylenburgh. The company is placed in their names, as are Rembrandt’s paintings,
                    graphic art, engravings and other artwork. He continues to paint, but retains no control over
                    business matters, and Titus becomes his universal heir. Rembrandt paints himself as the Apostle
                    Paul.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="chrono">1662</p>
                <p>On July 24, Hendrickje Stoffels dies from the plague and is buried in the Westerkerk in Amsterdam.
                    Rembrandt paints “The Sampling Officials of the Amsterdam Draper’s Guild” (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum)
                    and receives major commissions for portraits and other works from wealthy families, including the
                    well-known Trip family.</p>

                <p>Titus, Rembrandt’s son, dies shortly after marrying Magdalena van Loo, the daughter of a silversmith.
                    He is buried in the Westerkerk in Amsterdam, which is where his mother was laid to rest. Rembrandt
                    lives in Amsterdam with his illegitimate daughter Cornelia.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="chrono">1669</p>
                <p>On March 22, Rembrandt’s granddaughter, Titia van Rijn, is born six months after her father Titus
                    died. Rembrandt paints three self portraits in this year, which turns out to be his last.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="chrono">October 4, 1669</p>
                <p>Rembrandt dies and is laid to rest in an unmarked and rented grave in the Westerkerk in Amsterdam,
                    which is also where his son and common-law wife are buried. There is little information available
                    regarding the cause of his death, with one report suggesting it was due to temporal arthritis.</p>

                <h4>Rembrandt's masterpieces</h4>
                <p>Rembrandt painted many masterpieces, ranging in tone from the poignant Jeremiah Lamenting the
                    Destruction of Jerusalem to perhaps the most gruesome painting of the 17th-century, The Blinding of
                    Samson. Rebellious by nature, Rembrandt always took a unique and original approach in his art.</p>

                <p>The artist was a master storyteller, using subtle hand gestures or attributes to carry a narrative.
                    And as he aged, he increasingly omitted elements from his work. This approach enabled him to reveal
                    meaning even to the inattentive viewer. In The Jewish Bride, for example, Rembrandt showed the
                    couple caressing one another, rather than kissing, to convey their mutual love. And The Night Watch,
                    the most famous of all his masterpieces, offers new surprises with each viewing. Rather than posing
                    the militiamen, Rembrandt depicts them just as they are about to go into action. This makes for a
                    highly dynamic and movement-filled group portrait, rather than a statically posed one.</p>

                <h4>Rembrandt's self-portraits</h4>
                <p>The dozens of self-portraits by Rembrandt were an important part of his oeuvre. Rembrandt created
                    approaching one hundred self-portraits including over forty paintings, thirty-one etchings and about
                    seven drawings. The self-portraits create a visual diary of the artist over a span of forty years.
                    They were produced throughout his career at a fairly steady pace, but there is a gradual shift
                    between etchings, more numerous until the 1630s, to paintings, which are more common thereafter.</p>
                <p>His oil paintings trace the progress from an uncertain young man, through the dapper and very
                    successful portrait-painter of the 1630s, to the troubled but massively powerful portraits of his
                    old age. Together they give a remarkably clear picture of the man, his appearance and his
                    psychological make-up, as revealed by his richly weathered face.</p>
                <p>Scrolling through the gallery, you will see how the artist's image changes over time.</p>

                <h4>Rembrandt's engravings</h4>
                <p>As well as paintings, Rembrandt produced etchings and prints – he made around 300 in the period from
                    1626 to 1665. His surviving works on paper testify to a ceaseless drive for innovation. He used the
                    copperplate like a sketchpad, printing multiple versions and repeatedly modifying his composition.
                </p>

                <p>Rather than scratching a wax-coated plate, as many other etchers did, Rembrandt used a dry needle to
                    etch directly into the copperplate. This technique is known as drypoint.</p>
